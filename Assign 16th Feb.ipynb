    "Q1.What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that enables efficient retrieval and manipulation of the data.\n",
    "Databases are used in a wide range of applications, such as web-based applications, mobile apps, and enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases that differ in their data models and query languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) \n",
    "databases are relational databases that use tables to store data, where each table represents an entity or relationship between entities. \n",
    "SQL databases use a structured query language (SQL) to manipulate and retrieve data, and are based on the relational data model. \n",
    "SQL databases are known for their ability to handle complex queries and transactions, and are often used in enterprise applications where data consistency and transactional integrity are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) \n",
    "databases are non-relational databases that use various data models, such as document-based, key-value, graph-based, or column-family, to store data.\n",
    "Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not use a fixed schema, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability. \n",
    "NoSQL databases are often used in modern web applications and big data systems, where scalability and high availability are more important than strict consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are based on a structured data model, use a structured query language, and are typically used in enterprise applications, whereas NoSQL databases use various data models, are more flexible, and are often used in modern web applications and big data systems"

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary key and foreign key are both important concepts in database design that are used to establish relationships between database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key\n",
    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. \n",
    "A primary key is used to ensure that each row in the table can be identified and accessed in a unique way. \n",
    "A primary key must be unique, non-null, and not changeable. By convention, primary keys are often named \"id\" or \"name of the table\" followed by \"_id\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a database that stores information about employees, the \"emp_id\" column can be defined as the primary key for the \"employees\" table. \n",
    "This ensures that each employee in the table can be uniquely identified by their employee ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. \n",
    "A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, allowing data from one table to be linked to data from another table. \n",
    "The foreign key column in one table references the primary key column in another table. \n",
    "This allows you to create a link between the two tables, enabling you to retrieve data from both tables using a single query.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a database that stores information about employees and their departments, the \"emp_dept_id\" column can be defined as a foreign key in the \"employees\" table, referencing the primary key \"dept_id\" in the \"departments\" table. \n",
    "This establishes a relationship between the \"employees\" and \"departments\" tables, allowing you to retrieve data about employees and their departments using a single query."
